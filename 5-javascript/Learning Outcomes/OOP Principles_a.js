//OOP PRINCIPLES



//



//Explain the “Single Responsibility Principle”.
// Every function should only have one responsibility
// Every function should only do 1 thing


//Briefly explain the additional SOLID principles.
// Single Responsibility,
// Open for extensions / Closed for Modifications => A module or a part of code should be extendible but not to be modified.
// Liskov Substitution => If it swims like a Duck and quacks like a duck but needs batteries you probably have a different kind of abstraction.
// Interface Segregation => Abstractions should be seperated from each other on interaction phase
// Dependency Inversion => Different modules should be decoupled as much as possible when interacting each other.



//Explain what “tightly coupled” objects are and why we want to avoid them.
// TCOs are heavily dependent to each other that if we change one of them that means we need to change many others too. We don't want this.
